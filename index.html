               <p class="lead" style="font-size:14px;">

                We are looking for people who care for their loved ones (mom, dad, aunt, spouse etc.) to take part in a research study. The focus of this study will be on your caring habits. We aim to use these findings to understand how to respond and manage the needs of the people who care for their loved ones in a more efficient and effective way. <br><br>

                If you participate you will be invited for an interview (Phase 1) to get a sense of your caring process (the interview could be over Skype or face-to-face depending on your preferences). After the interview, you will be asked to participate in a diary study  (Phase 2) for a week which should take a maximum of 10 minutes each day. At the end of the study you will be invited to take part in a Focus group (Phase 3) in London where you will be provided a chance to communicate with other participants in this study to exchange views together. <br><br> All the phases mentioned above would be organized at your convenience. It will be up to you to decide to take part in either of the phases. During this study, you will not be asked to provide any access to the people you care for.

               <p class="lead" style="font-size:14px;">The growth of an ageing population and people with long-term conditions is a challenge to the current health care strategy. King fund organization’s [Appleby 2013] published report points out, the people with long-term conditions, i.e., around 15 million, will rise by a third in the next 10 years. Users with long-term conditions will account for more than 70% of inpatient beds and half of all general practitioners (GP) appointments in England [Wilson et al., 2013]. </p>
